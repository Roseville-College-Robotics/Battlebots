# Battlebots season is upon us!
Welcome to Github! In this repository, you will find the code you need to get started!

## BattleMods
This is the library that you will be using to help program the robot! Feel free to read through what it does, but simply it just condenses the objects and functions that you call, as well as adding a few quality of life additions.

## example.py
Not sure where to start? This program shows you how to initialise your robot. It also goes over the basics of loops, if statements and movement.
